DESIGN DECISIONS:

1. Started out with TrigramParser which would take in a String and return a 
   HashMap with first 2 words of a trigram as the key and the third word 
   adding to a list of values for the key.
2. Added a utility method to the parser which would return a list of 3 word trigrams.
3. Next was TrigramGenerator this would take the trigram map built from
   TrigramParser and would generate the new sentence. 
4. Lookup the keys of the TrigramMap against the word pair that is sent in.
   Get a random word from it's value in the trigramMap and append it to the new sentence,
   Continue till the last two words exist as a key in the map.
